	        <h2>Cuzo: 2017</h2>
		        <p>This shirt was inspired by my cousin's school photo that I took from my auntie's house. The shirt was apart of a collection I did called the "Family Portrait," in which I turned my interpretation of various family member's personalities into designs. Tap or click on the photo to see the shirt in AR.</p>

          <h2>mommyandfriends: 6/14/20</h2>
            <p>I often look through my mom's old art specifically her photographs. She grew up in Cabrini-Green in Chicago. That's why I always watermark her photos with "Cabrini Green Queens" lol. I've always expressed to her interest in working with art and tech and she told me to do both, so a lot of stuff on this page is just me tinkering with both, because I can. Tap or click on the photo to interact with the AR.</p>
